Welcome to **GO-Trainee** on GitHub. Here, we inspire interns to dive into the world of **Go** and create educational projects using this programming language. Our goal is not only to teach you new skills but also to support you throughout your learning journey.

- If you're a **Trainee**, come [this way](https://github.com/GO-Trainee/welcome).
- If you're a **Mentor**, you're welcome [here](https://github.com/GO-Trainee/mentor-guides).
- And if you're just a curious **stranger**, feel free to enjoy our open repositories!
